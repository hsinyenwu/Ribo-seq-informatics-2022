## Ribo-seq-informatics-2022

1. Please keep in mind that we did not write most of these software here so please contact the authors if you have any question.
2. This workshop is not aimed for teaching R or linux. Basic knowledge for coding will be helpful.
3. Best to run RiboTaper or ORFquant on cluster or server. Laptop usually takes too long.
