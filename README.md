## Ribo-seq-informatics-2022

1. Please keep in mind that we did not write most of these software here so please contact the authors if you have any question.
2. This workshop is not aimed for teaching R or linux. Basic knowledge for coding will be helpful.
3. Best to run RiboTaper or ORFquant on cluster or server. Laptop usually takes too long.

### Topics:
1. Brief introduction for Ribo-seq and protocols
2. Ribo-seq data analysis and visualization
3. Public resources and future directions

### Ribo-seq data analysis with RiboTaper
1. [Required software](https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/RiboTaper_126/): Bedtools executables (v2.17) and R (3.0.1) with the following packagesseqinr_3.1-3, ade4_1.7-2, multitaper_1.0-11 , doMC_1.3.3, iterators_1.0.7, foreach_1.4.2 and XNomial_1.0.1)
2. Data requirement (RNAseq+Riboseq)
3. Code example

### Ribo-seq data quality control with Ribo-seQC
#### Check if the modified function works for the sample dataset
1. Run Ribo-seQC 
2. [Calculate periodicity](https://github.com/hsinyenwu/Ribo-seq-informatics-2022/blob/main/Ribo-seqQC%20calculate%203nt%20periodicity.md)
3. 


### Ribo-seq data quantification with ORFquant

### Ribo-seq visualization with RiboPlotR

Other Topics
1. Obtain P sites from ORFquant output
2. All files in the same folder for running ORFquant
3. Fields required for the GTF
4. Prepare the GTF
