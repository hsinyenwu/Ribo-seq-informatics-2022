## Ribo-seq-informatics-2022

1. Please understand that we did not write most of these software here so please contact the authors if you have questions.
2. This workshop is not aimed for teaching R or linux. Basic knowledge for coding will be helpful.
3. Best to run the quality control steps, RiboTaper and deltaTE on cluster or server. Laptop usually takes too long.
